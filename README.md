# Minimal Weather App
I developed a project using Flutter, a powerful framework for cross-platform applications. By applying basic API principles, I integrated weather information from a website into the application. This involved selecting a suitable API (OpenWeatherMap API), designing an intuitive UI, and utilizing Dart to process and display real-time weather data such as temperature and weather type. This project exemplified the seamless integration of Flutter with API technology for practical applications.
